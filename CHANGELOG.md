### Known Current Bugs

* Installing Ruby 2.3.1 on Fedora requires a patched version of 2.3.1\. As patching is currently unavailable please pin to a prior version if you need this installing.

## [1.2.1] - 2017-06-23

* Fixed resource failures on Chef 13
* Updated the Apache license string to a SPDX compliant string
* Added Travis testing for Chef 12 and 13
* Switched testing from Rake to local delivery

## [1.2.0] - 2017-04-11

* Migrated maintenance of this cookbook to Sous Chefs
* Remove the check to see if the homebrew provider exists since this always exists in Chef 12 and the code failed on Chef 13
* Added checks to user install recipes to avoid breaking if the rbenv_home does not exist
* Removed test deps from the Gemfile as we should be testing with ChefDK
* Removed the "suggests 'java'" metadata as suggests was never implemented in Chef and has been removed from Chef 13
* Bumped the required Chef release from 12.0 to 12.1

## [1.1.0] - 2016-06-17

## [1.0.1] - 2015-10-24

* Fixed failure with rehashing after the cookbook was renamed

## [1.0.0] - 2015-10-12

### WARNING: Cookbook has been renamed

* Renamed to ruby_rbenv and uploaded to Supermarket (all attributes rename in the rbenv cookbook). If you wrap this cookbook you're going to need to update the recipes you include. All providers have been updated to keep their existing rbenv_xyz names for backwards compatibility and attributes still maintain the rbenv namespace.
* Updated Travis config to run integration tests in Travis using kitchen-docker

## [0.9.0] - 2015-10-12

* Fixed base platform case statement in the cookbook that set install_pkgs and user_home_root attributes. This has been converted to a platform_family statement to better support derivitive operating systems and the attributes are set at default levels so they can be overwritten in wrapper cookbooks
* Updated Travis to test using Chef DK vs. Gem installs
* Fixed Chefspecs and Test Kitchen bats tests to all pass
* Added the Apache 2.0 license file
* Updated and added new development dependencies to the Gemfile
* Use Chef 12.1+ multi-package installs for the dependency packages to speed up installs
* Removed the empty Vagrant recipe
* Actually depend on ruby_version vs. suggests since suggests isn't implemented in Chef

## [0.8.1] - 2015-08-28

* Add rbenv_action attribute to rbenv_ruby LWRP so to allow using rvm-download rbenv plugin to download ruby vs. installing ruby
* Fix the ability to install gems to a specific version of ruby
* Remove Chef version checks around use_inline_resources since we require Chef 12
* Use default_action method in the LWRPs
* Fix various rubocop warnings

## [0.8.0] - 2015-07-27

* Drop support for Chef versions prior to 12
* Add Arch linux support
* Add Linux mint support
